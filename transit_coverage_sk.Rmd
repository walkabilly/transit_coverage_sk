## Developing Saskatoon or Saskatchewan Transit Coverage 

We are using the [Spatial Access Measures](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/27-26-0001/272600012023001-eng.htm) developed by Statistics Canada. From the website: 

> There are seven types of amenity categories within the Spatial Access Measures: primary and secondary educational facilities (EFs), postsecondary educational facilities (PSEFs), health care facilities (HFs), places of employment (EMPs), grocery stores (GSs), cultural and arts facilities (CAFs), and sports and recreational facilities (SRFs). For each amenity, there are four variants based on the transportation mode: access via public transit during peak hours, access via public transit during off-peak hours, access via cycling and access via walking.

## Data 

```{r}
transit_peak <- read_csv("acs_public_transit_peak.csv", name_repair = "universal")

transit_peak$acs_idx_hf <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_idx_hf)
transit_peak$acs_idx_emp <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_idx_emp)
transit_peak$acs_idx_srf <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_idx_srf)
transit_peak$acs_idx_psef <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_idx_psef)
transit_peak$acs_idx_ef <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_idx_ef)
transit_peak$acs_lvl_gs.1 <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_lvl_gs.1)
transit_peak$acs_lvl_gs.3 <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_lvl_gs.3)
transit_peak$acs_lvl_gs.5 <- as.numeric(transit_peak$acs_lvl_gs.5)


transit_peak <- transit_peak %>%
                        group_by(CMANAME) %>%
                          mutate(n = n())
                  

transit_peak <- filter(transit_peak, n >= 1000)
```

The dataset fields are as follows

## Creating average values per city

```{r}
summary(transit_peak$acs_idx_hf)

transit_peak_city <- transit_peak %>%
                        group_by(CMANAME) %>%
                          summarize(acs_idx_hf = mean(acs_idx_hf), na.rm = TRUE,
                                    acs_idx_hf = mean(acs_idx_hf), na.rm = TRUE,
                          )

transit_peak_city <- arrange(transit_peak_city, acs_idx_hf)

kable(transit_peak_city, "markdown")
```
